# Devise Intro
A basic introduction to auth with Devise. This example starts with the [basic Rails tutorial blog](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). Examine changes at each commit if you want to understand implementation well. [See additional slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wRA3PBMcNh5nqfI6hp2mTG46oQdc36GK6V1g2p4qTGs/edit?usp=sharing).

This covers:
- additional fields on your registration form / permitted params
- adding login / logout buttons to your layout file
- authorization: all users can view articles, but only logged in users can create / edit / destroy articles

## Key Terms
- **authentication**: logging in / am I who I say I am?
- **authorization**: am I allowed to access these particular resources?
